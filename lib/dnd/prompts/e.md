Please update the implementation in the following ways:

- Change "accepts" so that it is a simple array representing the accepted item types.
- Update the example so that items dropped into a drop zone are removed from where they were dragged from and added to the drop zone. Support dragging between dropzones.
- Visually indicate which dropzones are valid and invalid for the currently dragged item.
- Finish implementing keyboard navigation.
- Fix the BSP tree issues.
- Fix the react testing environment issues.
